### G'Day All, 

My name is Sasitheran Vijayasingam, but you can call me SASI. I am a final year Information Technology Student (Majoring in Computer Science) and Minoring In  Mathematics and Technology Justice. I grew up in Kuala Lumpur Wilayah Persekutuaan (W.P.), The Capital of Malaysia and was fortunate to be given the chance to pursue my tertiary education in Brisbane, Queensland at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), a well appointed university for high school students looking to advance themselves in the domain of technology as it focusses more on a hands on approach to learning as oppossed to a 100% examination based approach. I am due to graduate sometime in August 2022 and will be actively Software Development roles within the next couple of months, leading up to my graduation. My interest are in a plethora of areas, some of which I have listed below: 
  
  -> Data Analysis (Using Industry Tool (E.g. R, Python, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Studio, Tableau, Microsoft PowerBI, Alteryx, SAS, MATLAB, etc)
  -> Data Science (Machine Learning (Testing and Training Models to Improve Model Prediction Accuracy) and Machine Learning (Bias Reduction in Artificially Intelligent Systems))
  -> Research Analysis (Domains of Interest: ESG (Economic, Social and Governance) and MI (Market Intelligence))
  -> Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frameworks: Angular, Vue, Backbone, Express, REACT, D3, etc)
  -> Quantum Computing, Quantum Physics, Quantum Mechanics, etc. 
  -> Network Engineering (Specialising in Cisco Hardware, Meraki, Aruba, Juniper, and HP Commercial Networking Equipment)
  -> System Administration (Working with a host of Operating Systems: Microsoft Windows, MacOS and even Linux)ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on further improving some of the skills I have mentioned above and further developing my portfolio. You can find a lot of things on my GitHub, such as Personal Projects, Basic Tutorials on Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms, Open Source Contribution, Instagram Posts about Software Development / Data Analysis and Plenty of Articles on Software Development, Data Science, Foreign Policy and International Relations. At this moment, I am advancing myself in the domain of Cybersecurity (Penetration Testing, Blue Team Strategies, Red Team Strategies and Purple Team Strategies), and so, expect to see content on that from time to time on my GitHub. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning refreshing my basics on Python and It's applications in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, API Design, and Microservice Construction. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Instagram, Facebook and Possibly even YouTube
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Front End Web Development (Particularly with JavaScript Frameworks such as REACT, ANGULAR, VUE, D3, Express and Backbone)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything technology related. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to contact me, using my mobile number: Within Australia (0410 950 313) or Outside Australia (+61 410 950 313), or alternatively, you can always reach me at my Email: sasitheran@vijayasingam.org
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am against a formal education in a technology specific domain but am completely for being a self taught technology professional, as I am now.
